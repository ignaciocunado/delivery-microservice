# Part 4: Mutation Testing

## 4.1 Introduction
The mutation testing framework PiTest (/paɪ tɛst/) analyses the robustness of a test suite by injecting faults into the source code. 
If the test suite is able to detect the injected faults, it is considered robust. We use this to analyse the quality of our tests.
In this report we will examine the changes the mutation testing framework made to our code and discuss the results.
